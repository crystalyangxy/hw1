P&amp;E HOMEWORK 1
In these changed files I adjust some numbers in fill in "function Draw". 
When I changed the first "fill", It changed the start point and. And I increase the number in second fill on the second one the color also changed. But the other number on second fill I changed just changed the position. 
As I increased the right numbers in radius random( , ) in "function setup" the size of bubbles changed. As the number increased the size of bubble also increased.
I changed bubble.x/bubble.y. 
        ellipse(bubble.x, bubble.y, bubble.radius*2);
        bubble.x += random(-1, 1);
        bubble.y += random(-1, 1);
When I changed the sized to more the -1 or 1, the bubbles float up and disappare. As the numebers increased the speed also increased.
